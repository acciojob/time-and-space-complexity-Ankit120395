	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to measure how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. It tells you how efficient an algorithm is.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the measure of how much memory (RAM) an algorithm needs to run, as a function of the input size n. When we say an algorithm has O(n) space complexity, it means the amount of extra memory it needs grows linearly with the input size n.</p>
